This project is about prostate cancer risk

This is a synthetic dataset obtained from Kaggle

Who is my audience?  I imagine my audience to be physicians who want to know more about prostate cancer risk and statistics

What is my project?  
  I want to convey: 
    A) What is the likelyhood of having prostate cancer based on other factors
    B) How do factors mitigate the risk of prostate cancer.


After working with the data and doing a little research, I believe it would be more informative for you the audience, and more entertaining for myself if I used a real dataset.
I'm uploading the work I have completed on it and I will be starting over with a real dataset.
