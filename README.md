# prostate_cancer_health_project

This is a personal project using synthetic data obtained from Kaggle.  This project demonstrats ggplot2 to draw graphs to convey information, and also include models that predict the relationship between the variables and each risk level.  In the future, I do not recommend using synthetic data, as it does not provide real world context to a problem.
